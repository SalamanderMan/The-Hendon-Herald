                    <p>The Ghost of General Havlock appears to be considering using the canon left in Mowbray park - in
                        protest at moving his bin collection to Tuesdays instead of Thursday.</p>

                    <p>The cannon, left pointing at the civic centre in case of another infestation of the Rage virus
                        seems
                        to be the target of the Victorian Millitaryman Shade's attentions.</p>

                    <p>When pressed, the wraith said "I'm buried at Lucknow, so getting here to put the bins out for
                        Tuesday
                        is impossible, the connecting flights just aren't there."</p>

                    <p>Keen shoppers were undeterred as Blandford Street at the heart of the city was seen to be a bit
                        skew-wiff.From Herbet Brown's to Debenhams, the whole street appeared tilted off to the rught
                        somehow.</p>

                    <p>We contacted a spokesperson for H&T Pawnbrokers said "To be honest, we haven't noticed anything
                        unusal outside. There has been no drop off in trade, punters are here putting their wedding
                        rings on

                        Street look wonky too- normally they'd be upri...oh.. wait..."</p>

                        behaviour

                <p>Our chief editor, Ahab McRadgie has had a long career in the media, despite his youth. Starting off
                    taxing dafties for 20p, who he assured he needed the money to get home to his dying grandmother. He
                    soon
                    set to work selling the Big Issue, then graduated on to harder, more potent local newspapers.</p>

                <p>Ahab has been given a Regional Press Award for his scoop "Ryhope man catches train" and a restraining
                    order after the incident with the inflatible crocodile, the vodka and small arms we don't talk
                    about,
                    but none one will ever forget. Even though we tried hard. So, so hard.</p>
