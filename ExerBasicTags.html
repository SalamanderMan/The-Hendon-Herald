    <h1>This is a heading 1</h1>
<p>This paragraph explains about headings - headings are used in text to provide headings. When searching engine
    robots index pages it gives headings more importance than just normal paragraphs.</p>

    <h2>This is a heading 2</h2>
<p>This paragraph explains 2nd headings. These can be thought of as sub-headings under the 1st level headings.
    Google best processes them as such, but treats lower headings as far less important. Google's SEO guide
    has information about this.</p>
